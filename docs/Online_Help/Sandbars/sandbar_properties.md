title: Sandbar Properties
layout: default

Viewing the properties of a sandbar is achieved by opening the list of sandbar sites from the `Views` menu and then then double clicking the site in question. Note that this opens a *read only* view of the sandbar properties. To *edit* the properties of a sandbar, right click on the site and select `Edit`. There is a video demonstration of the sandbar site properties view at the bottom of this page.

## Basic Properties

The basic  properties tab lists all the attributes that the workbench maintains for a particular sandbar site. Again, each of these basic properties is editable, but not in this read only view.

## Surveys

## Area and Volume Analysis

Click [here](/online_help/sandbar_analysis/sandbar_results/) to read more about viewing the area and volume results from the sandbar analysis.

## Map

The map tab shows a Bing Maps aerial image of the sandbar site. This requires the site to have the **latitude** and **longitude** properties to be set.

## Remarks

The remarks tab shows the long form text description for the site. Again, this information is edited by right clicking on the sandbar site back in the main list of sandbar sites and selected `Edit`.
